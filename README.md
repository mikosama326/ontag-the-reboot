# Ontag - A New Way to Experience your Music

Hi! I see you have found our (see below for the names of the people who worked on this project) final year project: Ontag.

At its core, it's an auto-tagging algorithm that tags new music based on your descriptors. And then, it uses these automatically generated tags to recommend music to you!

What does that mean?

Well, imagine you have some music that you consider to be great background music while cleaning. Then, you could tag that music as 'cleaning'. Or you could tag it as 'relaxing', 'soft', 'gym'. Whatever kind of descriptor you want to use.

Now you can use these text tags you have applied on known music to tag new music as it enters your library.

This algorithm is currently wrapped into a online music streaming app. So it'll recommend new music to you based on the tags you've applied.

That means that, if you're currently listening to a music you tagged as 'cleaning', then it'll recommend new music you can download and stream that you would also likely tag as 'cleaning'.

The app is currently only for mobile. The file 'ontag.py' runs the server. All songs hosted are stored in the 'songs' folder (if that wasn't already obvious.) Feel free to contact me (Srija, see email address below) if you have any questions. ^^
